# CodeStandard

This is the colaborative repository for  **Hackathon SORTEE's Code Club Hackathon: Creating a Code Standard** on Wed Oct 16 2024, 06:00-07:55 UTC +00:00 for the Society for Open, Reproducible and Transparent Ecology & Evolution (SORTEE).

# How to work in the repository

Clone the repository to your computer by creating an R project or buy using the git command bellow: 

`git clone https://github.com/SORTEE/CodeStandard.git` 

> ## Important! 
>
> After clone the repository, switch to the `hackathon` branch. You will not be allowed to push changes to the `main` branch. 
> Commmand: `git switch hackathon` or `git checkout hackathon`
> Make sure you are in the right place: `git branch`

# Repository structure

The repository has six folders with the same internal structure. Each folders is to be used by one of the working groups during the Hackathon. 

Folders: 

|_ ADD NAMES
|_ 
|_ 
|_ 
|_ 
|_ 

In each folder we provide the code (the same code) to be reviewed and modified in the Hackathon. The idea is that from the same innitial code we will have different outputs of code. So after the hackathon we can go trough the modification and unify it in a single code/folder. 

# Good pratices for colaboration in github

We are colaborating in git/github to allow multiple people to edit code and colaborate in the same project. 
Since we are several people in the same repo at the same time, we need to avoid have conflicts of code. 
We suggests that: 

- Avoid work in the same file at the same time. Discuss within your group the tasks before work in a particular file. Let people know that you are working there. 
- Commmit and push often. Always pull and accept the merging before push your commits. 
- If you need to solve conflicts, make sure you can resolve an commit. If you are unsure, discuss with your group or call the hosts before change and commit the file.
